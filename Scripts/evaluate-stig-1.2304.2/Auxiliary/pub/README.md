# Evaluate-STIG Auxiliary Files

These are optional files to use in conjunction with Evaluate-STIG.

### Evaluate-STIG.yml

An Ansible playbook designed to assist with remote Evaluate-STIG scans in a Linux-only environment. The default host list is set to "all"; please adjust as necessary. The playbook does modify "/etc/sudoers" temporarily to allow for rsync without a password. The playbook will remove this line regardless of if the sync passes or fails. The privileged user prompt is the user added to "/etc/sudoers" for the duration of the sync. The local path is where the Evaluate-STIG results are saved on the local host machine. The final part of the playbook cleans Evaluate-STIG from the remote host.  Previous scans are purged from the local host machine prior to syncing to defined local directory due to how the sync is designed.

**Note:**  The Evaluate-STIG directory must reside in the same directory as the Evaluate-STIG playbook -e.g. both Evaluate-STIG.yml and Evaluate-STIG in /etc/ansible.  `sudo bash Evaluate-STIG_Bash.sh --DownloadPS` should be run prior to executing the playbook.
